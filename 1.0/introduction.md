## Learning More

Laracasts has a comprehensive and **free** [video course](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-laravel-forge) on Forge which you should check out if you're using Forge for the first time.

## Forge IP Addresses

If you are restricting SSH access to your server using IP whitelisting, you should whitelist the following IP addresses:

- `159.203.161.246`
- `159.203.163.240`

:::tip IP Address Changes

The Forge IP addresses may change from time to time; however, we will always email you several weeks prior to an IP address change.
