## Overview

The Forge Circles feature allow you to collaborate with team members that may manage servers and sites on your behalf. You can create as many Circles as you would like and add as many team members as needed to each circle.

:::warning Business Plan Only

## Creating a Circle

You may create a circle via the [Forge dashboard](https://forge.laravel.com/circles). The first thing you need to do is provide a name for the Circle. Once the Circle has been created, you may manage it by clicking the edit button next to the Circle's name. This will open a modal window that provides two features:

1. Invite friends to the circle. You need to enter an email address that is already has an account on Laravel Forge. If they do not have an account, a free account may be created by clicking "Just joining a circle?" during the Forge registration process.

2. Add servers to the Circle. Anyone within this Circle will be able to manage the selected servers.

3. Attach credentials to the circle. This allows you to share the ability for circle members to create new servers on your behalf.

:::tip Inviting Friends

For team members who are only joining Circles and are not managing their own servers, you can sign up using the "Just Joining A Circle?" link on the registration page.

## Deleting Circles

You can delete Circles via the [Circle](https://forge.laravel.com/circles) dashboard by click the delete button next to the Circle's name. You will be asked to confirm the deletion before it is actually deleted.

## Renaming Circles

This is not possible within the Forge dashboard, but you can delete the Circle and re-create it or, if you have a lot of servers / members you may contact Forge support.
