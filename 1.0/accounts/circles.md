# Circles

[[toc]]

## Overview

Circles are a concept in Forge that allow you to add team members to manage servers and sites on your behalf. You can create as many Circles as you'd like and add as many team members as needed to each circle.

:::warning Business Feature Only
Circles are only available on the Business plan.

## Creating a Circle

Creating a [Circle](https://forge.laravel.com/circles) is done through the Forge dashboard. The first thing you need to do is provide a name for the Circle. Once the Circle has been created, you can then press the edit button next to the name of it. This will open a modal that provides two features:

1. Invite friends to the circle. You need to enter an email address that is already signed up to Forge.
2. Add servers to the Circle. Anyone within this Circle will be able to manage the selected servers.

:::tip Inviting Friends

For team members who are only joining Circles and are not managing their own servers, you can sign up using the "Just Joining A Circle?" link on the registration page.

## Deleting Circles

You can delete Circles through the [Circle](https://forge.laravel.com/circles) page in the Forge dashboard. This is as easy clicking the delete button next to the name of the Circle you want to delete. You will be asked to confirm the deletion before it is actually deleted.

## Renaming Circles

This is not possible within the Forge dashboard, but you can delete the Circle and re-create it or, if you have lots of servers / members you can email forge@laravel.com.
