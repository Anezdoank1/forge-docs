## Business Receipts

If you need to add specific contact or tax information to your receipts, like your full business name, VAT identification number, or address of record you can add Extra Billing Information from the [Subscription page](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/subscription) in your account. We'll make sure it shows up on every receipt.

## Downgrading To The Hobby Plan

If you wish to downgrade to the hobby plan, you'll need to contact support at [forge@laravel.com](mailto:forge@laravel.com).

## Deleting Your Account

You can delete your account at any time from the [Subscription page](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/subscription).
