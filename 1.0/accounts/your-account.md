# Your Account

## Updating Your Profile Information

You may update your name, email and password from the Forge's [Authentication dashboard](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/authentication) within your user profile at any time.

## Securing Your Account With Two Factor Authentication

You can add Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to your account from the [Authentication page](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/authentication). Once you enable 2FA, please remember to scan the 2FA barcode into your phone's authentication application.

When you first enable 2FA Forge will show you:

- A QR code (which you should scan)
- A security code (if you can't scan the QR code)
- Several recovery codes

The recovery codes should be stored securely and can be used if you don't have your 2FA device to hand. Recovery codes can only be used once. You may re-generate these at any time from your account's dashboard.

:::tip Using 2FA
We recommend using the [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) application on your smartphone to manage your Forge 2FA configuration.

## Billing

### Business Receipts

If you need to add specific contact or tax information to your receipts, like your full business name, VAT identification number, or address of record you can add Extra Billing Information from the [Subscription page](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/subscription) in your account. We'll make sure it shows up on every receipt.

### Downgrading To The Hobby Plan

If you wish to downgrade to the Hobby plan, please contact support at [forge@laravel.com](mailto:forge@laravel.com). You must have only one server (including archived servers) before submitting a request to downgrade to the Hobby plan.

### Deleting Your Account

You can delete your account at any time from the [Subscription page](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/subscription).

:::danger Account Data

Deleting your account will cancel your subscription and delete all of your account's data. **Your data, including billing information, will not be recoverable**; however, your servers will be preserved.
