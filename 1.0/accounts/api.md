## Overview

Forge provides a comprehensive API that allows you to programmatically manage your Forge servers and sites.

You can read the Forge API documentation [here](https://forge.laravel.com/api-documentation).

:::tip API Security

Forge does not currently make use of oAuth Scopes. Be careful supplying a Forge token as you are giving unrestricted access to your servers and sites.

## Create API Token

To interact with the Forge API you will first need to generate an API token. Tokens are used to authenticate your account without providing personal details.

You can create as many tokens as you need for your individual integrations.

## Remove Token

If you no longer need an API token, you may remove it by clicking the **X** button next to the token name.
