# SSL

[[toc]]

## Overview

Forge supports installing custom SSL certificates and using LetsEncrypt to generate free certificates for your websites. 

## LetsEncrypt

[LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) provides free SSL certificates that are recognized across all major browsers.

If you need to install LetsEncrypt for multiple domains, you may separate multiple domains using commas.

### Cloning a LetsEncrypt Certificate

Because of the LetsEncrypt renewal process, it is not possible to clone LetsEncrypt certificates. You will need to issue a new certificate.

## Existing Certificate

You can also install purchased certificates through the Forge UI.
